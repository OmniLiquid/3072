v 1.0

 First stable version of 3072.

 2048 grid changed to 6x6.

 Random tiles changed to 2's and 3's with probability .5.

 Win condition changed so a tile equal to or over 2048 wins.

 Colors changed to be more visible and better looking, imo.

v 1.1
 
 Probabilities changed: should be 60% 2's, 12% 4's, 22.4% 3's, 5.6% 6's now. Testing is needed to find a good balance.

 "P" key now moves tiles a random direction. You can lose quickly by mashing it.

v 2.0

 Twitter button removed.

 Added diaganals. Now QWEADZXC move tiles in the direction from S that they are.

 Removed "R" for restart. Too easy to hit while aiming for "E"
